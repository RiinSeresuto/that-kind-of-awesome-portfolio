#### The Portfolio

This one is every self explanatory, it a portfolio websites which will contain my projects, some proffesional but mostly personal projects, my skills, little bit about myself, and work history.

This was made using [Astro](https://astro.build/). Building this project helped me explore the Content Collection and View Transition API of the framework. I also utilized [Hero Patterns](https://heropatterns.com/) for background pattern on the website.
