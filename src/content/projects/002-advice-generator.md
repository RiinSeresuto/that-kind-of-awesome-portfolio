##### This Application

It is a challenge from Frontend Mentor ([here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db)) which forces me to utilized the `fetch()` api on JavaScript. This simple project is my gateway on learning API connection that really helps me build the foundation of an API.
